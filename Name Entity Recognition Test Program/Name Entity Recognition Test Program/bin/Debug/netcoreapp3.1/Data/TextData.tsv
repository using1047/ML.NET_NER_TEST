B6C3F1,Swiss Webster mice	0	0	0	Nothing	1	Acute Exposure/ The sensory irritating potential of a series of saturated and unsaturated aliphatic and cyclic aldehydes was investigated in B6C3F1 and Swiss Webster mice.
Two animals	100	1	7	days	1	Acute Exposure/ Two animals were dosed with 100 microliter of test substance in the eye and observed for 7 days. The test substance was slightly irritating to the rabbit eye in this test.
male Hartley guinea pigs	500	1	4	wk	1	Subchronic or Prechronic Exposure/ Four-week-old male Hartley guinea pigs were exposed to the test substance (500 ppb) for 4 wk (6 hr/d, 5 d/wk).
GP	0.1	1	0	Nothing	1	At the end of exposure, GPs were challenged with an OA aerosol (0.1% in NaCl) and pulmonary functions were measured.
guinea pigs	0	1	0	Nothing	0	The day after, guinea pigs were anesthetized and several endpoints related to inflammatory and allergic responses were assessed in blood, whole-lung histology, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL).
Does not exist	0	1	0	Nothing	0	Exposure to the test substance did not lead to an allergic reaction after the challenge with OA on any of the parameters investigated.
GP	0	1	0	Nothing	0	In the nasal cavities slight irritation (metaplasia/hyperplasia) of the respiratory epithelium was observed. Histological examination of the trachea and lungs showed a slight irritation of respiratory epithelium for nonsensitized GPs.
rats	800	1	0	Nothing	1	Final mean body weights of rats that received 800 mg/kg were 14% lower than those of the vehicle controls for males and 11% lower for females.
Does not exist	0	1	0	Nothing	0	Compound-related clinical signs were not seen in animals that survived to the end of the studies.
mice	1600	1	3	day	1	all mice that received 1,600 or 3,200 mg/kg /by gavage/ died by day 3.

Does not exist	0	0	0	Nothing	0	Immediate first aid: Ensure that adequate decontamination has been carried out.
Does not exist	0	0	0	Nothing	0	If patient is not breathing start artificial respiration preferably with a demand-valve resuscitator bag-valve-mask device or pocket mask as trained. 
Does not exist	0	0	0	Nothing	0	Perform CPR as necessary. Immediately flush contaminated eyes with gently flowing water. 
Does not exist	0	0	0	Nothing	0	Do not induce vomiting. If vomiting occurs lean patient forward or place on left side (head-down position if possible) to maintain an open airway and prevent aspiration. 
Does not exist	0	0	0	Nothing	0	Keep patient quiet and maintain normal body temperature. Obtain medical attention. 
Does not exist	0	0	0	Nothing	0	Basic treatment: Establish a patent airway (oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal airway, if needed).
Does not exist	0	0	0	Nothing	0	Watch for signs of respiratory insufficiency and assist ventilations if necessary.
