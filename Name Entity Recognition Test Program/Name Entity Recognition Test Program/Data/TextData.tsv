B6C3F1,Swiss Webster mice	1	Acute Exposure/ The sensory irritating potential of a series of saturated and unsaturated aliphatic and cyclic aldehydes was investigated in B6C3F1 and Swiss Webster mice.
Two animals	1	Acute Exposure/ Two animals were dosed with 100 microliter of test substance in the eye and observed for 7 days. The test substance was slightly irritating to the rabbit eye in this test.
male Hartley guinea pigs	1	Subchronic or Prechronic Exposure/ Four-week-old male Hartley guinea pigs were exposed to the test substance (500 ppb) for 4 wk (6 hr/d, 5 d/wk).
Does not exist	0	At the end of exposure, GPs were challenged with an OA aerosol (0.1% in NaCl) and pulmonary functions were measured.
guinea pigs	1	The day after, guinea pigs were anesthetized and several endpoints related to inflammatory and allergic responses were assessed in blood, whole-lung histology, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL).
Does not exist	0	Exposure to the test substance did not lead to an allergic reaction after the challenge with OA on any of the parameters investigated.
Does not exist	0	In the nasal cavities slight irritation (metaplasia/hyperplasia) of the respiratory epithelium was observed. Histological examination of the trachea and lungs showed a slight irritation of respiratory epithelium for nonsensitized GPs.
